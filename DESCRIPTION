Package: Zillow
Version: 0.1-1
Title: Simple interface to Zillow.com's house price estimate API
Description: This package provides relatively simple
  facilities for querying Zillow.com for information
  about estimated house prices for a property.
  It allows one to get information about a particular property
  and also about up to 30 "comparable" properties.
  The information includes price estimate, range for the estimate,
  tax assessment and year, zip code, lot and finished square feet,
  number of bedrooms and bathrooms, date and price last sold.
  All of this is made available by Zillow. This package is merely
  an illustration of how this information can be retrieved in R via
  Web services using the XML and RCurl packages.
  To use this, you will need to have a Zillow account and
  Zillow Web Services Id (ZWSID).
Depends: XML, RCurl
